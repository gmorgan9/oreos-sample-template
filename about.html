                The Oreo was one of several new cookie inventions rolled out in 1907 by Lyons Foods, and the snack was introduced to consumers in 1908, the company says.
                <br><br>
                The cookie later became a staple at grade schools and summer camps, and the names of the cream fillings changed over time. The cookie was an essential staple in the bag of the sweet-like, cornflake-flavored General Mills Cupcake Crisps, and was often included in cookie packages with the foods of choice for hungry schoolchildren.
                <br><br>
                In the 1930s, Oreo started using milk instead of milk powder, making it creamier. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Oreo started producing the cookie filled with real cream.
                <br><br>
                The package of the cookie also changed in 1971, when Oreo introduced three smaller boxes of cookies, stacked to look like an oreo. They stayed that way until 1984, when the larger “copper” box was introduced, featuring more than six cookies.
                <br><br>
                Whew! It seems like Oreos are in big trouble. Oreo's claim to fame is being the first to introduce a double stuffed cookie to the grocery store shelf. Their packaging is super cute and definitely makes a statement to the shoppers. Who could forget their regular sized Oreo Big Snack Bowl that requires so much willpower to keep from gobbling up every single bite? It would almost be sinful if I wasn't a conscious eater.
                <br><br>
                According to several reports, the Oreo Big Stuffed Cookie is a HUGE disappointment. The cookies are really just mini Oreo Oreo cookies, rolled up and stuffed in the store's filling. I say, bring it on!
                <br><br>
                The Oreo Big Stuffed Cookie will be a permanent addition to the Big Stuffed Cookie aisle at supermarkets and stores nationwide, and the packaging is completely customizable so shoppers can choose to give their own twist to the giant cookie.
